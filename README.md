# Bubble Sort

This project is a simple implementation of bubble sort with basic optimization. It takes an array of numbers and returns a sorted array. It sorts one less number (from the end) on every iteration.

Some interesting techniques I learned include:
* Using **nested loops**
* Swapping array elements by using **temporary variables** (a & b in this case)
* Using the **spaceship operator** to determine if two array elements are out of order
* Focusing on writing clear variable names to improve legibility
